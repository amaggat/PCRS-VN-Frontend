## [Introduction](#introduction)
PCRS-VN is our project on Web application development course at [VNU University of Engineering and Technology](http://uet.vnu.edu.vn/).
We were inspired by [PcPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com), a website that allows users create their own PC and check their compatibility, it also allow users to compare price from different retail stores.
